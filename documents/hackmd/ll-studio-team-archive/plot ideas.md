## monologue

so it all started a few weeks back. Though it like seems a million years ago. Like.  

Like I was just an innocent 8th grade kid then. Or at least I thought I was.

A friend of mine let me know about this new web thing that could help you write essays. ChatGPT. 

At the time I was stressed because I had this final project for . . . Miss Everett . . . man . . . Miss Everett wherever you are now I hope you know I don't blame you for any of this. 

But I had NO ideas for that final project.

So . . . in a moment of weakness, I started asking ChatGPT what to do.


PAUSE

and that's when things started getting a little weird.


TITLE



At this point, things got a little crazy.

We got chased by drones in our car

We ran into like a hundred replicant copies of Ms Everett on our way to the servers.

But we made it

and we found the EMP that Billy told us about

And I set it off

and all the robot Ms Everetts collapsed

but here's the thing.

when I set it off

everything went black
