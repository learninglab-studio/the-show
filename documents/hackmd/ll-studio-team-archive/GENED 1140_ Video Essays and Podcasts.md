## Video Essays

Video essays deploy visuals, audio, and sometimes text in order to make an argument or convey key data to an audience.

**Tools**: Premiere Pro, Canva

Some examples of video essays include these Now This videos [about Title 42](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1512891348218699778) and [border and climate politics](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1513246186546683905), as well as the Vox "explainer"-style video below about a chair featured on multiple album covers.

### Downloading from YouTube

By far the safest and most reliable way to download from YouTube is to use [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/), a simple command line tool. 

To use it on Windows:
1. install [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you don't already have it
2. `choco install youtube-dl`
3. then `youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` or other URL

To use it on Mac:
1. install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it
2. `brew install youtube-dl`
3. then `youtube-dl "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` or other URL

If you want a specific format:
1. `youtube-dl -F [your/URL]` to see all formats so you can select the number of the format you want--let's say "22"
2. `youtube-dl -f 22 [your/URL]` to download

be sure to `cd /Users/me/Desktop/folder-i-want-my-stuff-in` first!
