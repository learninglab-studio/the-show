## Some editing basics

**Ins and Outs**

To create a clip from footage that you have imported, you will want to create "ins" and "outs." These are essentially markers that you can apply to the original footage in order to bring a shortened clip into your timeline. The "in" will be the marker that indicates when you want the clip to being and the "o" where you'd like the clip to end. In Premiere Pro, you press "i" to create an in and "o" to create an out. Then, you click on the image in the preview window (usually in the top left of the editing workspace) and drag the clip into your timeline. 

**Voiceover narration over an existing clip**
Voiceover is helpful way to guide your viewer through the claims and analysis you'd like them to understand. This voiceover can accompany an existing clip, serving as your commentary on the film. In some video editing software, like Adobe Premiere, you can record and add voiceover narration. Below, the red microphone icon shows that voiceover is being recorded.

**Separating audio from visual tracks**
Separating the audio and visual tracks allows a film editor to pair a film clip with audio captured at a different point in time or in a different setting (and vice versa). In Premiere, you can "unlink" the audio from the visual tracks by right clicking the clip in your timeline and selecting "unlink."
