# designLab 20220204

Today, DeisgnLab launched with a lab on focal length. We discussed exposure and the relationship between ISO, aperture and shutter speed. There were some interesting suggestions on how to make sense of this and visualise the relationship between these componsents: cubes in a square, slices of cake...

We took turns racking focus between objects and exploring fun ways this technique can be used to aid thought processes and learning.  For example, we shifted the focus from the mini wooden mannequin in the foreground to Jessie mirroring its stance in the background. Other ideas included:
* shifting focus between a group of people sharing their ideas
* between someone and their reflection in a screen or mirror
* and between two people writing comprarive or contrasting works or someone drawing what the other had written.

Below is our full brainstorm of ideas for: things we could rack focus between (purple); moves we could make between focus points (pink); how these can support courses learning objectives (red).

Finally, we used some of these ideas to create a storyline that we could portray by racking focus between three people. Jessie and Charlie appeared to be happily in love but the camera's focus shifts as we see Charlie's hand secretly holding Sophie's behind her back.

From our brief exploration it's clear that exercises like this have lots of potential for storytelling, thought processing and visualising relationships between different actors / sources / components to a piece of work. There is a lso a lot of opportunity to learn more practical skills with the cameras, lighting and editing.
